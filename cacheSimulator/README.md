## What is a cache? 
Caches are a part of computer architecture, and they store frequently used data to improve a programs performance by reducing access time. A computer can have multiple caches, depending on how much data there is to be referenced. Typically, in computers there are three levels of caches, the smallest L1 (64KiB), medium sized L2 (256KiB), and the largest L3 (16MiB).
